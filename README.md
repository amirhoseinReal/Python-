# Customer Call Data Cleaning Project

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of my data cleaning skills using Python's pandas library. As a beginner data analyst, I undertook this project to showcase my ability to preprocess and clean data, which is a critical step in any data analysis workflow.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: `CustomerCall.ipynb` - Contains the code and process used to clean the dataset.
- **Cleaned Dataset**: `improved.xlsx` - The final cleaned dataset saved in Excel format.
- - **Raw Dataset**: `Customer Call List.xlsx` - The Raw dataset saved in Excel format.

## Data Cleaning Process

In this project, I performed the following data cleaning steps:

1. **Loading Data**: Imported the raw dataset from an Excel file using pandas.
2. **Identifying and Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values by filling them or dropping rows where necessary.
3. **Standardizing Data**: Ensured consistency in data formats, such as phone numbers and other categorical variables.
4. **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
5. **Exporting Cleaned Data**: Saved the cleaned dataset into a new Excel file for future analysis.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for this project.
- **pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and cleaning tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used to run the code and document the process interactively.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Handling missing data and ensuring data quality.
- Using pandas for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.
- Preparing datasets for analysis, which is essential for a career in data analytics.
